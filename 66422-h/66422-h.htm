<p class="drop-cap2">AT the word style the critics at once
sit up and take notice. We are all
sensitive to style; we either like to drift with
an easy, lazy current, or we prefer to fight
a turbulent, resisting tide; we enjoy contemplating
the moonlight upon tranquil
waters, or we find our greatest pleasure in
watching the ruffian billows breaking
against rough shores. These are largely
matters of temperament or of mood. The
attitude of many of us changes from day
to day, from book to book; but at heart we
all have a preference, a prejudice in favor
of certain methods of writing, while others
awake our antagonism. It has probably<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
been the experience of all of us that books
that reach the library table often lie unopened
for many days; and then to our own
surprise we some day take them up, read
them with delight, and wonder why we approached
them so reluctantly. In the same
whimsical fashion we recur to volumes that
we knew in old times, impelled by some
instinct that makes us long to experience
the same emotion, the same thrill, the same
peace that gladdened our souls in happier
days. There are books that fit into moods
of sorrow, of loneliness, of anxiety; and
others are equally identified with moods of
happiness, elation and hope. There are in
all our libraries, great or small, stern Gibraltars
that rise gloomily before us on shelves
to which we never turn with pleasure.</p>

<p>Great writers have rarely written of style,
perhaps because it is so individual, so intimate
a matter; and the trick of the thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
may not, except in rare cases be communicated
to the tyro. The convenient methods
of absent treatment advertised by correspondence
schools of authorship are of no
avail in the business of style; style can
no more be taught than the shadows of
clouds across June meadows, or the play
of wind over wheat fields can be directed
or influenced by the hand of man. To
grasp style much is inevitably presupposed,&mdash;grammar,
sensibility, taste, a feeling for
color and rhythm,&mdash;of such things as these
is the kingdom of style. In children we
often observe an individual and distinctive
way of saying things; we all have correspondents
whose letters are a joy because
of their vivid revelation of the writer. In
every community there are persons much
quoted for their wit or wisdom, whose sayings
have a raciness and tang.</p>

<p>The bulk of English is so enormous and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
increases so rapidly that we have a right to
pick and choose and to hang aloof from all
that does not please us. The fashion
changes in literary style as in clothes, and
yet,&mdash;to shift the figure,&mdash;the snows of
yesteryear linger on the far uplands and
high peaks, and they are there forever. It
is a common impression that popular taste
in literature is bad and growing worse. I
do not myself sympathize with this idea.
The complaint smells of antiquity: every
age has had its literary Jeremiahs; the wail
that of making many books there is no end
is older than American literature; for is it
not written: &#8220;Many of them also which used
curious arts brought their books together
and burned them before all men; and they
counted the price of them and found it fifty
thousand pieces of silver.&#8221;</p>

<p>It would be instructive, if there were
time, to review the labors of those who have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
first and last written on the subject of style.
We might with profit and entertainment
discuss the general superiority of English
poetry to English prose; but this is a matter
conceded, I believe, by sounder critics than
your orator; we might linger by the golden
coasts of Greece and harken to the voice of
Plato who&mdash;says Frederic Harrison, alone
is faultless; we might follow C&aelig;sar&#8217;s eagles
into Roman territory and hear, at the
Sabine farm, Ars Poetica read by a most
competent witness on this question of style.
Here is a man to our liking, this Horace,
and we find him eminently modern in his
attitude toward the dictionary: &#8220;Mortal
works must perish,&#8221; he says, who was born
two thousand years ago; &#8220;much less can
the honor and elegance of language be long-lived.
Many words shall revive which now
have fallen off; and many words which are
now in esteem shall fall off, if it be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
will of custom, in whose power is the decision
and right and standard of language.&#8221;
Other witnesses speaking many tongues
crowd the door, but we must stick to our
text. It is our mother English that now
concerns us, and only a few may be allowed
to testify at this session of the court. You
will not, I pray, take my <i>obiter dicta</i> too
seriously. I beg you to deal leniently with
my stupidity when I say that such prose
as Addison&#8217;s or Steele&#8217;s has little charm for
me; it is, as Mr. James might say, <i>nice</i>;
but it lacks variety, flash, ginger; and if I
prefer Swift, Defoe or Carlyle to Milton,
pray do not deliver me to the lions. As an
advocate of the open shop in criticism I insist
on my right to punch and hammer at my
own bench in the corner beside yours. In
thus frankly divulging my likings and aversions,
I hope&mdash;to quote Doctor Johnson,
that &#8220;I am not preparing for my future life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
either shame or repentance.&#8221; Let us assume
that all the authoritative testimony on
this subject is in evidence and a part of the
<i>res gest&aelig;</i>,&mdash;Newman on Language in &#8220;The
Idea of a University&#8221;; Spencer&#8217;s &#8220;Philosophy
of Style&#8221;; certain passages from
George Henry Lewes&#8217; &#8220;Principles of Success
in Literature&#8221;; De Quincey&#8217;s eloquent
and stimulating essay on &#8220;Style&#8221;; and discussions
of the same fascinating subject by
Stevenson, Pater and Frederic Harrison,
and by Antoine Albalat in French,&mdash;these
we file with the clerk. And not to know
Professor Walter Raleigh&#8217;s essay on Style
is to have missed a discussion of the subject
which is in itself a model of graceful, melodious
writing, guiltless of preciosity.</p>

<p>There must always be a difference between
the style of genius and that which
proceeds from ordered, controlled and directed
talent. The dead level of mediocrity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
is easily attained in both prose and poetry,
but even persons of little cultivation feel the
lure of captivating speech. The world has
been swayed by the power of phrase. The
trumpet and drum may take hold of man&#8217;s
emotions, but words only can touch his mind
with truth. The words of Jesus are marvelously
simple; there were undoubtedly
those among his contemporaries who could
contrive more splendid orations; there were
citizens of the Roman empire of which he
was a humble citizen who were richer in
learning.</p>

<p>Antoine Albalat, in &#8220;The Travail of
Style,&#8221; discusses in separate chapters the
literary methods of such writers of supreme
rank as Pascal, Bossuet, Buffon,
Montesquieu, Rousseau, La Fontaine, Racine,
Balzac, Chateaubriand, Victor Hugo
and Flaubert. And he conducts this discussion
in an immensely interesting and original<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
way, namely, by reproducing the actual
manuscripts of the great writers themselves,
with the countless erasures and substitutions
of words, phrases and whole passages
they made. What toilers, what galley
slaves of the pen, they were! one cries in
amazement! The first draught is as nothing.
It serves simply as a point of departure,
to blot, to cover with spider tracks of
erasures and emendations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this the work of inspiration, this galley-slave
toil at the dull mechanic pen?&#8221; demands
a critic. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; the writer of the book
replies. &#8220;When Buffon declared &#8216;Genius is
but infinite capacity of patience,&#8217; do you
take him for a fool who meant to say: &#8216;If
the veriest dolt sits long enough on a chalk
egg he will hatch out a phoenix&#8217;? No,
he meant that as much inspiration of genius
goes into thoughtful correction and brooding
revision as into the first jet of composition.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
When the now more fiery, more
pathetic word suggests itself, it is even
more a flash of inspiration than the primary
suggestion of the older and poorer one.&#8221;
Ah! if ever there was a book to confirm the
current saying, &#8220;Easy writing makes hard
reading,&#8221; it is this.</p>

<p>There is, as every one knows, an apparent
happy luck in writing,&mdash;the <i>curiosa felicitas</i>
that puts the inevitable word into your ink
pot. I offer the suggestion that composition
does not begin with the taking up of the
pen; that there are untraceable sub-conscious
processes that are never idle, whose
results illuminate many a treasured book.
He were a rash author who would attempt
to set apart his conscious felicities from his
inadvertent graces. How long do you suppose
Shakespeare pondered that most stupendous
incident in all literature&mdash;the
knocking at the gate in Macbeth? Tennyson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
when questioned as to his own power
over words once solemnly answered: &#8220;In
the beginning was the word, and the word
was with God and the word was God&#8221;&mdash;implying
a belief in inspiration.</p>

<p>Veracity is the final test in all art. It
makes no difference how trifling or unimportant
the thing that we would utter, or
whether we express ourselves in the cadences
of the symphony, in the militant
splendor of the epic, in the careless fling
of some vagrant poet&#8217;s tavern catch; or
whether the artist writes a landscape in colors
upon canvas, the test of beauty and
strength is first of all the test of truth. We
measure the far-shadowing spear of Achilles
and weigh the gleaming sword of Arthur
by the things we know to be beautiful and
strong. Words may lie before us like green
meadows by peaceful streams, but we must
feel the softness of the turf and hear the bubble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
of the stream or they fail as a vehicle; or,
in other departments of literature, they must
sweep toward us like a cavalry charge, and
we must hear the rattle of scabbards and
the pounding of hoofs until we draw back
struck with fear at the onset, or the artist,
who is like a captain over his troop, has
failed of his purpose. &#8220;My love for thee,&#8221;
wrote the poet; &#8220;my love for thee shall
march like armed men.&#8221;</p>

<p>The power of the printed word has always
been tremendous; the authority of
type is often excessive and unjustified; yet
this only makes more exacting the inevitable
standard of truth. Style will forever
be challenged by truth, that austere higher
critic whose method is so searching and
whose judgments are so inexorable. The
mere bows and ruffles, the chiffon flounces
of composition are easily flung off by the
literary milliner, but unless they are essential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
to the investiture of character they
crumple and pass to the garret. It is not
enough to communicate to the eye the sense
of form, the outward and visible outline of
a man; the shop keeper can do that with a
dummy in his show-window; but words
must go further and produce bone and
sinew; we must be able through the writer&#8217;s
magic to clasp a hand that is quick with red
blood; whose contact thrills us at a touch.</p>

<p>This is as true in those characterizations
that are the veritable creatures of realism
as of those that are wrought in the mood of
romance. The burden upon your romancer
lies, in fact, more heavily, for in his work
the spectator, the auditor, the reader, can
assist him little. Silas Lapham, for example,
is within the range of our common
experience; what the author may omit we
supply; whereas D&#8217;Artagnan rides in from
a strange and unexplored land, and we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
must be convinced of his cleverness, his
courage, his skill with the sword. When
Beatrix comes down the stair to meet
Esmond we must hear the rustle of her
skirts, feel the fascination of her smile, and
be won by the charm of her voice;&mdash;we
must hear the pretty click of her slippers
on the stairs. And we may say, in passing,
that Thackeray carried style as an element
of English fiction higher than it was ever
carried before and no one since has shaken
his supremacy.</p>

<p>Few writers of the Victorian period
wielded a more flexible English than Matthew
Arnold, and few writers of any period
have shown greater versatility. His power
of direct statement was very great and he
plunged forward to the chief facts he wished
to present with the true journalist&#8217;s instinct
for what is interesting and important. As
a controversial writer he had few equals in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
his day, and many philistines went down before
his lance. The force of repetition was
never more effectively illustrated than in the
letters he launched against his assailants.
He was a master of irony, and irony in
skilled hands is a terrible weapon.</p>

<p>The vivacious Mr. Birrell complains of the
jauntiness of Arnold&#8217;s style in &#8220;Literature
and Dogma,&#8221; and we must confess that
Arnold pinned his tick-tack on the palace
windows of the bishops of Gloucester and
Winchester rather too often. But Arnold
had, too, the touch of grace and melody.
He was a master of the mournful cadence,
as witness the familiar and oft quoted paragraph
on Newman at Saint Mary&#8217;s with
which he opens his lecture on Emerson;
and even more beautiful is that passage in
one of the most appealing and charming of
his literary essays&mdash;the paper on Keats&mdash;in
which he thus plays upon Keats&#8217; own words:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
&#8220;By virtue of his feeling for beauty and of
his perception of the vital connection of
beauty with truth, Keats accomplished so
much in poetry, than in one of the two great
modes by which poetry interprets, in the
faculty of naturalistic interpretation, in
what we call natural magic, he ranks with
Shakespeare. &#8216;The tongue of Kean,&#8217; he
says, in an admirable criticism of that great
actor and his enchanting elocution; &#8216;the
tongue of Kean must seem to have robbed
the Hybla bees and left them honeyless.
There is an indescribable <i>gusto</i> in his voice;&mdash;in
Richard, &#8220;Be stirring with the lark to-morrow,
gentle Norfolk!&#8221; comes from him
as through the morning atmosphere towards
which he yearns.&#8217; This magic,&#8221; says
Arnold, &#8220;this &#8216;indescribable <i>gusto</i> in the
voice,&#8217; Keats himself, too, exhibits in his
poetic expression. No one else in English
poetry, save Shakespeare, has in expression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
quite the fascinating felicity of Keats, his
perfection of loveliness. &#8216;I think,&#8217; he said
humbly, &#8216;I shall be among the English poets
after my death.&#8217; He is; he is with Shakespeare.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great distinction of Newman&#8217;s style
lies in its extraordinary clarity. He wrote
for a select audience; his sermons even were
for the scholars of his university, and dealt
usually with the fine points of religious
philosophy. He was under scrutiny, the chief
spokesman of one of the most remarkable
movements that ever shook the Protestant
world, and of necessity he expressed himself
with scrupulous precision. After crystal
clearness a certain cloistral composure
follows naturally as a second characteristic
of his style. He was engaged upon a serious
business and never trifled with it. It
is unfortunate for literature that he confined
himself so closely to theological controversy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
or to kindred subjects that have lost their
hold on popular interest, for in the qualities
indicated&mdash;clearness and precision, and in
melody&mdash;he is rarely equaled in the whole
range of English prose. Religion in his
case was not a matter of emotion but of intellect.
Personal feeling flashes out so
rarely in his pages that we hover with attention
over those few lines in which he
tells us of his good-by to Oxford, and of his
farewell to Trinity College: &#8220;Trinity,
which was so dear to me, and which held
on its foundation so many who had been
kind to me both when I was a boy, and all
through my Oxford life. Trinity had never
been unkind to me. There used to be much
snap-dragon growing on the walls opposite
my freshman&#8217;s rooms there, and I had for
years taken it as the emblem of my own
perpetual residence even unto death in my
University.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>But there for a moment he was off guard:
and for an instance of his more characteristic
manner&mdash;for an example of that mournful
music which Arnold, in the familiar
paragraph to which I have referred, caught
so happily,&mdash;we do better to dip into such
a sermon as the famous one on The Theory
of Development, and I read from the page
as it falls open:</p>

<p>&#8220;Critical disquisitions are often written
about the idea which this or that poet might
have in his mind in certain of his compositions
and characters: and we call such
analysis the philosophy of poetry, not implying
thereby of necessity that the author
wrote upon such a theory in his actual delineation,
or knew what he was doing; but
that, in matter of fact, he was possessed,
ruled, guided by an unconscious idea.
Moreover, it is a question whether that
strange and painful feeling of unreality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
which religious men experience from time
to time, when nothing seems true, or good,
or right, or profitable, when faith seems a
name, and duty a mockery, and all endeavors
to do right, absurd and hopeless, and all
things forlorn and dreary, as if religion
were wiped out from the world, may not
be the direct effect of the temporary obscuration
of some master vision, which unconsciously
supplies the mind with spiritual life
and peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here in America style was first greatly
realized by Hawthorne. Changing tastes
and fashions have not shaken his position.
He was our first, and he remains our greatest
creative artist in fiction, and it were idle
to dispute his position. His work became
classic almost in his own day. He was no
chance adventurer upon the sea of literature,
but a deliberate, painstaking artist.
Fiction has rarely been served by so noble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
a spirit; and fortunate were we indeed could
we pluck the secret of style from his pages.
In his narrative there may sometimes be dull
passages; his instinct for form and proportion
may seem at times, by our later tastes,
to fail him; but his command of the language
is never lost; his apt choice of words
moves an imitator to despair; and felicity
of phrase, balance, movement and color
were greatly his. The cumulative power of
&#8220;The Scarlet Letter&#8221; is tremendous,&mdash;and it
is a power of style not less than of intense
moral earnestness. There is something
awe-inspiring in the contemplation of that
melancholy figure, in whose mind and heart
the spirit of Puritanism dwelt as in a sanctuary;
and yet he was always and above
everything else an artist. He was as incapable
of an inartistic idea as he was of a
clumsy sentence. Sitting at the receipt of
custom in the grim little village of Salem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
he took toll of stranger ships than ever
touched Salem wharves. Other figures in
American literature must be scrutinized
through the magnifying glass; Hawthorne
alone looms huge;&mdash;as Mr. James so happily
said of Balzac, Hawthorne&#8217;s figure is
immovable and fixed for all time. To mention
Irving, Poe or Cooper on the same page
is but to betray our incompetence for the
office of criticism. There are kindlier and
cheerfuller figures among American prose
writers, but Hawthorne alone is commanding,
noble, august.</p>

<p>After Hawthorne, the prose of Lowell affords,
I should say, the highest mark reached
by any American writer. The main difference,&mdash;and
it is a difference of height,
breadth, depth,&mdash;the difference between them
as prose writers lies in the fact that one was
a creative artist and the other a critic. And
criticism must always be secondary. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
enduring monuments of the literature of all
the ages were built before criticism was
born. The great originals in all literature
have paid little heed to criticism. The creator
must plow and sow and reap; the critic
may only seek the garnered harvest, nibble
the hay and chew his cud. The persistent
efforts of critics to magnify their own importance
proves their sensitiveness and the
jealousy with which they guard their self-conferred
prerogatives. The criticism of
literature is the only business in which the
witness is not called upon to qualify as to
his competency. Failures at any game naturally
turn critic. In science we demand
the critic&#8217;s credentials: in literature we all
kick the sleeping lion and inadvertently twist
his tail.</p>

<p>Lowell wrote with remarkable knowledge,
skill and effectiveness on many subjects, and
his political and literary essays are models<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
of form and diction. He was perhaps the
most cultivated man we have produced; he
drew from all literatures, and not less
from human experience; and he was singular
among American scholars in his life-long
attention to politics. He saw American history
in the making through years of great
civil and military stress. He was one of the
first to take the true measure of Lincoln.
He wrote a magnificent prose essay on Lincoln
before our martyred chief passed to the
shadows; and the postscript to that essay
touches, it seems to me, the higher altitudes
possible in prose, and deserves to be remembered
and repeated side by side with his Commemoration
Ode:</p>

<p>&#8220;On the day of his death this simple
Western attorney, who, according to one
party was a vulgar joker, and whom the doctrinaires
among his own supporters accused
of wanting every element of statesmanship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
was the most absolute ruler in Christendom,
and this solely by the hold his good-humored
sagacity had laid on the hearts and understandings
of his countrymen. Nor was this
all, for it appeared that he had drawn the
great majority, not only of his fellow-citizens,
but of mankind also, to his side. So
strong and so persuasive is honest manliness
without a single quality of romance or unreal
sentiment to help it! A civilian during
times of the most captivating military
achievement; awkward, with no skill in the
lower technicalities of manners, he left behind
him a fame beyond that of any conqueror,
the memory of a grace higher than
that of outward person, and of a gentlemanliness
deeper than mere breeding. Never
before that startled April morning did such
multitude of men shed tears for the death
of one they had never seen, as if with him
a friendly presence had been taken away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
from their lives, leaving them colder and
darker. Never was funeral panegyric so
eloquent as the silent look of sympathy which
strangers exchanged when they met on that
day. Their common manhood had lost a
kinsman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lowell&#8217;s prose like his verse was enriched
from the soil of many lands, but more and
more as he grew older he wore his learning
lightly. The self-consciousness of the
young professor, ever anxious not to be
tripped by the impertinence of some recalcitrant
student, gave way toward the end
to the easy discourse of a man sure of his
ground. A certain tendency to superficial
cleverness,&mdash;the stinging ironies of a yawning
professor with a dull class flash out of
his pages disagreeably at times, in odd contrast
with his true and always delightful
humor. Style must proceed from something
solider than mere cleverness. Your <i>tour de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
force</i> performer is lucky to be remembered
in a book of quotations; his definitive edition
goes to the back shelf of the second-hand
shop. Language with Lowell was a
ready and flexible instrument. I have said
that he knew men and books; he knew nature
also, and he observed the passing
pageant of his New England seasons with
a shrewd and contemplative eye. The
spring sunshine touching the old historic
trees at Elmwood; the flashing gold of the
oriole, the spendthrift glory of June days,&mdash;these
things communicated an imperishable
sunniness and charm to his writings.
How happily, in one of the best of his
papers&mdash;the essay on Walton&mdash;he has constructed
for us the character of the delightful
old angler. Walton, he darkly hints, is
not the artless old customer we have always
believed him; and you may be sure that only
a lover of letters and a believer in style for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
the style&#8217;s sake would chuckle&mdash;as we find
Lowell doing,&mdash;at seeing the angler hesitating
between two or three forms of a
sentence, solicitous to preserve only the best.
In his charming life of Herbert, after quoting
a poem of Donne&#8217;s, Walton adds a few
words of characteristic comment. They
wear a na&iuml;ve air; they seem to have slipped
carelessly from the pen. Walton wrote:
&#8220;These hymns are now lost to us, but doubtless
they were such as they two now sing in
Heaven.&#8221; &#8220;Now&#8221;&mdash;continues Lowell&mdash;&#8220;on
the inside cover of his Eusebius, Walton has
written three attempts at this sentence, each
of them very far from the concise beauty to
which he at last constrained himself. Simplicity,
when it is not a careless gift of the
Muse, is the last and most painful achievement
of conscientious self-denial.&#8221;</p>

<p>By the usual tests of style we might easily
deal harshly with Emerson; but nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
could be idler than any attempt to buckram
ourselves in the rules of the schoolroom in
studying the qualities that make for style.
Emerson&#8217;s diction was happily adapted to
the needs of his matter. His essays are like
the headings for homely lectures or jottings
from notebooks, and are almost as good
reading when taken backward as forward,
so little was he concerned with sequence or
climax.</p>

<p>The roaring, steaming style of his grim
old friend Carlyle never wakened any desire
for emulation in the sage of Concord.
Carlyle drives or drags you under the hot
sun of mid-day, and if you falter or stumble
he lays on the lash with a hard, bony Scotch
hand. He was what Sydney Smith called
Daniel Webster&mdash;a steam engine in trousers;
but Emerson addresses you with a fine
air of casualty when he meets you in the
highway; and if the day be fine, and if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
are in the mood for loitering, he will repeat
to you the Socratic memoranda from his
notebook. He is benignant, sanguine, wise,
albeit a trifle cold with the chill of winter&#8217;s
last fling at the New England landscape.
His usual essay reminds me of a string of
icicles on the eaves of a white, staring New
England house, aglitter but not yet adrip
in the March sun. He is as careless of
your attention as Walt Whitman when the
good gray poet copies the names of &#8220;these
states&#8221; from a geographical index. In spite
of his fondness for references to the ancients
he suggests Plato and Socrates far less than
Poor Richard or Abe Martin. He contrived
no new philosophy but he was a master-hand
at labeling guideposts on the dusty
highway of life. He could not build a
bridge to carry us across the stream, but he
could paint a sign&mdash;&#8220;no thoroughfare&#8221; or
&#8220;A fine of ten dollars for driving faster than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
a walk&#8221;: and happy is the youth who heeds
these amiable warnings. Proverbs fell as
naturally to his pen as codfish balls to his
Sunday morning breakfast. He is as
wholesome as whole wheat bread; but he has
a frugal method with the bread-knife and
the slices at his table are thin.</p>

<p>The more genial Lowell produces a cobwebbed
bottle from his cellar and takes care
to push it to your plate; he plies you with
cakes spiced from far lands, and rises anon
to kick the logs upon the hearth into leaping
flame that the room may be fittingly dressed
for cheering talk. Emerson patronizes you
and advises a sparing draught from the
austere-lipped pitcher of icy spring water.
At seventeen (I give you my personal experience
for what it may be worth), there is
something tonic in the very austerity of his
style,&mdash;his far-flung pickets that guard the
frosty hills. Later on, when the fires of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
youth have cooled somewhat, and we march
beside the veterans in the grand army;&mdash;when
proverbs have lost their potency and
the haversacks hang empty on our lean and
weary backs, we prefer, for the campfires,
authors of more red blood, and pass our battered
cups for literary applejack that is none
the worse for us if it tear our throats a little
as it gurgles down. Once he might throw
up his windows and call to us: Virtue is
the soul&#8217;s best aim; adjust your lives to
truth; and so on. But now that we have
tasted battle and known shipwreck, we present
arms only to the hardier adjutants of
the army of life who gallop by on worn
chargers and cry: &#8220;Courage, Comrade, the
devil&#8217;s dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eloquence of the truest and finest sort we
find in Ruskin at his happiest. He could
be as wayward and as provoking as Carlyle;
but he founded a great apostolic line of teachers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
of beauty, and when he was most abusive
he was at least interesting, and when he
was possessed, as so often happened, by the
spirit of lovely things, and color and form
and light wove their spell for him and he
wrought in an abandon of ecstasy, we are
aware of eloquence in its truest sense and
see style rising to its noblest possibilities.
His tremendous earnestness, his zeal, his
pictorial phraseology, the glow of language
struck off at heat,&mdash;these are things that
move us greatly in Ruskin. In his armory
he assembled a variety of weapons suitable
for various uses; he could administer mild
rebuke; he could expostulate a little stridently;
he could deliver us up to prison and
slam the door of a medi&aelig;val dungeon upon
us; whereas the sour old Scot used one
bloody bludgeon for all heads. Carlyle
was, to be sure, capable of tenderness&mdash;there
were, indeed, few feats possible in the literary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
gymnasium that he could not accomplish;
but when Jeannie got on his nerves there
was something doing in the Recording
Angel&#8217;s office. Keble, he declared, was an
ape, and Newman was without the brains
of a rabbit. He praised as violently as he
denounced;&mdash;everything was pitched in
thundering hyperbole. The great men of
the ages slunk through Carlyle&#8217;s study like
frightened steers through a slaughter house.
Where he hid his own iniquities during his
life time the genial Froude exposed them in
a new chamber of horrors at his death.</p>

<p>Macaulay always reminds me of a gentleman
whip driving a coach and four. He
manages his horses with a sure hand. His
speed is never too high; he knows the
smooth roads and rumbles along at a comfortable
gallop, swinging up to tavern doors
with grand climaxes. He writes as a man
writes who dines well and feels good; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
piles up a few pages of manuscript after the
supper gong has sounded just to show that
his head is still full after his stomach is
empty. He can turn his horses in the chancel
of a cathedral without knocking out a
single choir stall; he can drive under low
arches without ruffling his hat; his knowledge
of the road is complete; his confidence
reassuring. As you roll over the road with
the whip lash curling and cracking and the
horn blowing blithely you submit yourself
to his guidance with supreme faith that he
will never spill you into the ditch or send
you crashing into a fence corner. English
history unfolds before him like a charming
panorama. We smile but are not
convinced by that reference of Dr. Holmes
to the Macaulay flowers of literature. You
are proud of yourself to be reading anything
so wholly agreeable and apparently so wise.
The later scientific method of historical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
writing can not harden our hearts toward
Macaulay. A man whose pen never
scratched or squeaked is not to be set aside
for a spectacled professor in a moldy library.
His facts may be misleading but&mdash;he&#8217;s perfectly
bully reading!</p>

<p>It is difficult to speak of Stevenson, for he
has been so much cited, and his admirers
praise him with so much exuberance that
many are on guard against what is called
his charm. He has undoubtedly been
praised by some who liked his velvet coat
better than his writings; and yet when we
have dismissed these triflers and have locked
away the velvet jacket we must admit that
the applause of the tavern idlers is not without
reason. We have to do now only with
his style,&mdash;the style that is indubitably there.
It not only exists, but there is an eerie, luring,
Ariel-like quality about it that can not
readily be shaken off. He has told us with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
a frankness rarely equaled by men of letters
of the methods he employed in learning to
write: his confessions have been quoted <i>ad
nauseam</i>,&mdash;I refer to those paragraphs in
which he tells us how he played the sedulous
ape to many accepted masters of style in the
hope of catching their tricks.</p>

<p>The gods of his youth were certainly respectable,&mdash;Hazlitt,
Lamb, Wordsworth, Sir
Thomas Browne, Defoe, Hawthorne, Montaigne
and Obermann. He not only confesses
that he aped these models; he defends
the method: &#8220;Nor yet,&#8221; he says, &#8220;if you are
born original, is there anything in this training
that shall clip the wings of your originality.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stevenson liked a good phrase just as he
liked a good inn, or winter stars or a long
white road. A zest for life,&mdash;for the day&#8217;s
adventure, for the possibilities of the next
turn of the highway, for a pungent saying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
that might fall from the lips of a passing
beggar,&mdash;such things as these interested
him, and he accommodated his style to the
business of setting them forth in melodious
language. He realized in a fine way that
which we heavily call the light touch,&mdash;a
touch firm in its lightness and instinct with
nimbleness and grace. We should know
from his writings, if he had not been described
with so much particularity, that he
was a person of keen humor and delightful
vivacity. Everything that may be done with
the light touch he did and did well. He
renewed our interest in the essay; he wrote
poems marked by a shy but bubbling joy in
simple things; he mounted the fallen lord of
romance upon a fresh charger and sent
pirate caravels forth again to plunder the
seas. And as he sails the wide waters of
romance under flags not down in the signal
books, we may be quite sure that every bit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
of brass is polished to the utmost, that every
rope is in place and neatly coiled and every
sail furled tightly in the nattiest manner or
bent to catch the gale. Those cheerless
souls who never heard a whip handle rattle
a tavern shutter at midnight, who never
prowled about old wharves and talked with
tattooed sailormen; who are grim seekers
after realities and have no eye for the light
that never was on sea or land have no business
with Stevenson and had better stick to
tea, muffins and <i>The Ladies&#8217; Home Journal</i>.
And finally&mdash;for we must hurry on lest we
fall under that spell of his, let me say that
the sense of form and the instinctive blending
of word colors,&mdash;things of no light importance
in consideration of style, have not
in our time been better exemplified than in
the writings of Stevenson.</p>

<p>You will observe that I have been calling
the roll of names near to our own generation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
for these we may bring to a more
intimate scrutiny; and I am not among
those who are confident that the last word
was said in English style before the Victorian
era. The nervous energy of our
later English comes naturally with the
quicker currents of life. Milton, himself, if
he might reappear from the shadows, would
be sure to delatinize his speech, and accommodate
his manner, in all likelihood, to the
requirements of less monstrous subjects than
those offered by the decadent years in English
history which saw the blackguard
roundheads sticking their bloody spears
through cathedral windows.</p>

<p>The style of Mr. Henry James is much
discussed, frequently execrated and often
deplored; and even in a hasty glance like
ours over the bookshelves we must linger a
moment beside his long line of volumes.
Whether we admire or dislike him he is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
a negligible figure in contemporaneous literature.
He is one of the most interesting
writers of his time; he has uttered himself
with remarkable fullness; he has attempted
and succeeded in many things. His influence
upon younger writers has been very
great. Mr. Owen Wister has lately acknowledged
his own indebtedness; Mrs.
Wharton&#8217;s obligations are written large on
all her pages. Mr. James is, to use a
word of his own, immensely provocative.
The range of his interest is wide and his
cultivation in certain directions great. He
is not a scholar in the sense that Lowell
was; he has observed life in shorter perspectives;
his literary criticisms, which we may
take to be a key to his personal interests,
have dealt with nearer figures,&mdash;with Tourguenief,
Balzac and Stevenson. His paper
on Stevenson remains and will long remain
the most admirable and the most searching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
thing written on the lad in the velvet jacket.
Herein we find an instructive and illuminative
denotement of Mr. James&#8217; own attitude
toward this trade of writing; every writer,
he declares, who respects himself and his art
cares greatly for his phrase; but Stevenson,
he finds, cares more for life. Mr. James is
no scorner of phrase for the phrase&#8217;s sake
or of form for form&#8217;s sake. The essays
collected in &#8220;Partial Portraits&#8221; and &#8220;English
Hours&#8221; are written in a far directer
and simpler manner than his later tales.
There are few lean streaks in Mr. James&#8217;
writings. He sees through and all around
the things he writes about, whether it be a
city, a bit of landscape, a character of fiction,
or an author. When a subject takes
hold of him the aroused thoughts tumble
about in tumultuous fashion; he is not a little
cistern easily emptied but a great flowing
well. Most of us complain that in later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
years he has been inarticulate, or obscure,
and often utterly incomprehensible. There
is some justice in the charge, and it can not
be pretended that &#8220;The Golden Bowl&#8221; or the
essays he has recently printed on American
cities are easy reading. The style of these
later writings is radically different from that
of &#8220;Washington Square,&#8221; &#8220;Roderick Hudson&#8221;
and &#8220;The Portrait of a Lady.&#8221; But
the difficulties of this later manner may be
accounted for, I believe, on the theory that
his own amazing abundance throws his powers
of expression into confusion. We must
admit that Mr. James often stammers, sputters
and sticks. His creative vision is so
wide that his expression is often unequal to
representing it in the familiar symbols of
speech. It is at moments of this sort that he
leaves us to stumble in a dark stair-case; then
suddenly we are aware of his leading hand
again, urging us on, and down the hall a brilliant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
light flashes forth, and we are able to
see things again with his eyes as his expression
once more catches step with his ideas.
His power of phrase is very great indeed.
Certainly no other American writer equals
him in the knack of flinging into a few words
some positively illuminating idea. A phrase
with him has often the brilliancy of the spot
light in the theater, that falls unexpectedly
upon the face of a concealed player and holds
for a moment the attention of the spectators.
I take up without previous examination a
paper on the City of Washington in &#8220;The
American Scene&#8221; and read this passage:
&#8220;Hereabouts,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;beyond doubt, history
had from of old seemed to me insistently
seated, and I remember a short springtime
of years ago when Lafayette Square itself,
contiguous to the Executive Mansion, could
create a rich sense of the past by the use of
scarce other witchcraft than its command of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
that pleasant perspective, and its possession
of the most prodigious of all Presidential
effigies, Andrew Jackson, as archaic as a
Ninevite king, prancing and rocking through
the ages.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seems, in this later manner which has
been so much discussed, to have lost his contact
with the old familiar symbols of feeling
and sense and to have resolved the world
into a place of sublimated abstractions,
which he describes sometimes with a stammering
and inadequate tongue and again in
bursts of rugged eloquence and with amazing
penetration. The smoothness of the
ordered thought, the pretty balances, the
march and swing of the old cadences of our
speech are either beyond him or beneath him,
and in a man of so acute and full a mind
and with a sophistication so complete in all
that makes for beauty, we can not do less
than subscribe to the theory that he knows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
what he is about and that his style, in the
curious phase to which he has brought it,
is a true expression of the oddly oblique lines
and strangely concentric circles of his matured
mind.</p>

<p>Eloquence is, I have sometimes thought,
the rarest quality that may be embraced in
the essentials of style. We need not quibble
over definitions. &#8220;Eloquence,&#8221; said Dean
Farrar, &#8220;is the noble, the harmonious, the
passionate expression of truths profoundly
realized, or of emotions intensely felt&#8221;; and
it is sufficient for our purposes. The term
is applied commonly and uncritically in
oratory. I have not myself found the reading
of the speeches of great orators profitable,
charmed they never so marvelously in
their own day. The old school readers
served us well in this particular by their admirable
selections.</p>

<p>Judgments of the ear and of the eye vary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
widely. The sentences that read well will
as likely as not fall flat when spoken, even
when uttered with force. The oration delivered
on the field of Gettysburg by Edward Everett
is commonly spoken of in contemptuous
contrast with Lincoln&#8217;s utterance
on the same occasion, but there can be no
fair comparison between the two performances.
Everett was indisputably one of the
greatest forensic orators of his time,&mdash;scholarly,
elegant, impressive. What Lincoln
wrote and read at Gettysburg was
not an oration but&mdash;to use Carl Schurz&#8217;s
happy characterization of it&mdash;a sonorous and
beautiful psalm. The familiar story that
Lincoln began and finished that address on
the train between Washington and Gettysburg
was denied by Mr. John G. Nicolay,
who has somewhere written a most interesting
account of its preparation.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine a severer test of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
the mind&#8217;s gift of expression than the extemporaneous
speech, evoked by some emergency
and spoken without premeditation.
Such instances are indeed rare, for your
orator is, I find, something of a liar. He
likes to give the impression of readiness of
tongue and wit; whereas the speech he has
flung off at some crisis of a debate, seemingly
produced on his feet, may have been
carried in his mind for weeks.</p>

<p>We Americans have long been accustomed
to florid style of public address. I remember
hearing it said often in my youth that
the newspaper was driving out the orator,
but I do not believe that this is true, or that
it will ever be true. The glow and passion
of the spoken word must always hold a fascination
for men that is not possible in the
printed appeal. The general rise of popular
intelligence raises the standard somewhat;
mere bombast and spread-eagleism&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
nimble ascent to pyramidal climaxes,&mdash;is
less effective as the years go by; but the
spell-binder has not yet been superseded.
He may not always convince, but he dare not
be dull, and he now and then rises to the
level of a Benjamin Harrison, who combined
the cogent reasoning of the deeply philosophical
lawyer with a rare art in marshaling his
facts, and addressed himself to the conscience
and the reason of his audiences.</p>

<p>Terror and horror are rarely evoked by
our later orators. Even the slaughter of the
innocents in the Philippines in the amiable
Christian effort to extend our beneficent
empire to Asia has brought forth no really
striking protest worthy of the cause. In
the same senate chamber where the hired
counsel of the railways and other trust-protecting
and subsidy-hunting felons subsequently
thwarted the will of the American
people, Thomas Corwin, a senator in congress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
from Ohio, on the 11th of February,
1847, thus delivered himself on the continuation
of the war with Mexico. I quote this
paragraph from Senator Corwin&#8217;s speech in
reply to Senator Cass of Michigan merely to
illustrate the possibilities of passionate oratory
skillfully employed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Sir, look at this picture of want of room!
With twenty millions of people, you have about
one thousand millions of acres of land, inviting
settlement by every conceivable argument, bringing
them down to a quarter of a dollar an acre
and allowing every man to squat where he
pleases. But the Senator from Michigan says
we will be two hundred millions in a few years
and we want room. If I were a Mexican I
would tell you, &#8216;Have you not room in your own
country to bury your dead men? If you come
into mine we will greet you with bloody hands
and welcome you to hospitable graves.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>And while we are touching upon the literary
style of statesmen you will pardon me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
for quoting further, in illustration of the reluctance,
caution and restraint that may
check the exuberance of personal feeling,
from a statement made by Colonel Theodore
Roosevelt in January, 1904: He said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;In John Hay I have a great Secretary of
State. In Philander Knox I have a great Attorney-General.
In other Cabinet posts I have
great men. Elihu Root could take any of these
places and fill it as well as the man who is now
there. And, in addition, he is what probably
none of these gentlemen could be, a great Secretary
of War. Elihu Root is the ablest man I
have known in our Government service. I will
go further. He is the greatest man that has appeared
in the public life of any country, in any
position, on either side of the ocean, in my
time.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Criticism offers no adequately descriptive
word for this type of reserved, unventurous
statement. Let us consider whether it may
not properly be styled the imperial theodoric.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>Now, in conclusion,&mdash;if such <i>disjecta
membra</i> as these may have a conclusion&mdash;we
have only skirted the nearer coasts;
what you have heard has been the merest
memorandum of a somewhat haphazard
voyage. No hour&#8217;s excursion can carry us
far in our quest of the secret of style.</p>

<p>If the wide sea of literature could be
charted, then we all might find the ports into
which the master mariners have sailed their
crafts; but we labor with a broken oar and
our log book is a tame record of vain attempts
to land on impossible shores. We
see many great ships hull down on the horizon,
but dare not follow them far;&mdash;the
majestic caravel of George Meredith bearing
ingots of pure gold, as rough and clean
as Browning lyrics; and close beside it the
stately craft of George Eliot,&mdash;would that
there were time to go aboard and wrest their
secrets from them! And I must not omit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
that rarely gifted English woman, Mrs.
Alice Meynell. Her prose happily expresses
the delicacy and grace of an imagination
whose province lies beyond the Ivory Portal
of the Realm of Dreams.</p>

<p>Turning inland we see deploying upon a
glittering plain an army with banners, preceded
by a mitered host chanting in deep
Gregorian. <i>Entre per me!</i> shouts a charging
knight galloping forward with a great
clatter of arms and armor. We recognize
one of Maurice Hewlett&#8217;s many inventions.
Hewlett manages an archaic manner admirably;
a trifle over-elaborate maybe, but
there is muscle beneath the embroidery.
Afar off steams the battleship Rudyard Kipling,
and we know the young Admiral for
a man of high courage, at home on land or
sea, in the air above or in the waters under
the earth. And if we may pause for one
word, we may say that the tremendous importance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
the hardly calculable influence of
the English Bible on English style has nowhere
in our generation been better evidenced
than in the writings of Kipling.
Not merely that he so often quotes from the
Bible; not so much that biblical phrases
abound in his pages; but that the directness,
the simplicity, the rugged power of Hebrew
narrative imparts a singular distinction and
force to all he writes. Young writers, intent
upon the best possibilities of our mother
English, do well to leave all that the great
Greeks, the great Latins, the great Italians
and French have written until they have
wrought,&mdash;into the very alphabet of memory,&mdash;the
innumerable lessons and high examples
of that imperishable text book of
English style.</p>

<p>Ah, if it were a mere pagan chronicle; if
it were the least spiritual book in the world,
still we who love English literature must go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
to it, as one who thirsteth, to a familiar and
well-loved spring, longing for it verily as
&#8220;David longed, and said, oh, that one would
give me drink of the water of the well of
Bethlehem, that is by the gate!&#8221;</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
